/**
 * Screentone: the manga grammar of shading, mood and texture.
 *
 * ## The one rule
 *
 * TONE IS A NON-DESTRUCTIVE LAYER. A tone never touches the pixels of the
 * character, scene or object it sits over. Hiding the tone returns the artwork
 * exactly as it was, because the artwork was never changed — the tone is a
 * separate item in the panel's layer stack that happens to be drawn on top.
 *
 * ## Why procedural tones are not images
 *
 * A screentone is a PATTERN, not a picture. Storing "40 dots per 100px at 45°,
 * 30% coverage" and drawing it at output resolution keeps the dots circular and
 * crisp at any export scale. Storing a bitmap of that same pattern and scaling
 * it produces the two classic failures: soft grey mush where the dots were, and
 * moiré where the sampling grid beats against the dot grid. So the document
 * stores PARAMETERS and the renderer draws from them — the same contract the
 * existing procedural effects already keep.
 *
 * Generated and uploaded tones ARE images: a rain texture or a flower pattern
 * is not describable as density and angle. Those keep the transform-and-tile
 * path instead. Both kinds are ordinary reusable library material.
