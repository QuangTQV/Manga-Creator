/**
 * The single policy for generating any asset that will later be cut out.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Characters, props, expression variations, SFX graphics and manga-language
 * decorations all need transparency, and each used to decide its own backdrop
 * through `selectBackgroundStrategy`. Coloured artwork got a **magenta chroma
 * key**, which is the root cause of the purple fringe that kept coming back:
 *
 *   - a saturated screen is blended into every anti-aliased edge pixel by
 *     definition, so the contamination is created deliberately, at generation
 *     time, before any extraction code runs;
 *   - the model also bounces the screen colour onto hair strands and silhouette
 *     edges as *intended* artwork, which no post-process can separate;
 *   - and every extraction path then had to be taught to undo it, so a single
 *     path that forgot reproduced the halo.
 *
 * Decontamination made the symptom recoverable. Not introducing the matte makes
 * it impossible. White cannot tint anything, so an edge blended with white is a
 * lighter version of the artwork rather than a different hue.
 *
 * ## Why white is safe here specifically
 *
 * Only because extraction is connectivity-based: the perimeter flood removes
 * background reachable from the border and never enters enclosed regions. White
 * shirts, eye whites, highlights, paper and jewellery survive because they are
 * fenced in by artwork. A global "near-white becomes transparent" rule could
 * not use this strategy at all.
 *
 * There is exactly one exported decision here. Nothing else may choose a
 * backdrop, and no component should carry its own "#FFFFFF" string.
