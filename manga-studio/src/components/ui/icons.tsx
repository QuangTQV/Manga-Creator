/**
 * The one icon system.
 *
 * Every functional glyph in Kumanga comes from Lucide, at one size and one
 * stroke weight. Re-exporting them here rather than importing from
 * `lucide-react` all over the tree means the sizing contract lives in one file,
 * and a future swap is one edit.
 *
 * Emoji are not icons. They render as somebody else's artwork at somebody
 * else's colour and weight, they change between platforms, and they read as a
 * chat message rather than a tool. None appear in the product UI.
 *
 * The Kumanga bear is BRAND, not a UI icon — it lives in `components/brand` and
 * never stands in for an editor control.
