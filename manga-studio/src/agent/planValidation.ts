/**
 * Grounded plan validation — the gate between "the model proposed this" and
 * "the document is mutated".
 *
 * Two jobs:
 *
 * 1. **Bind names to IDs.** Every character-referencing argument is resolved
 *    once, here, against the grounding report, and the resolved `characterId`
 *    is written into the step. Execution then works from a stable ID instead
 *    of re-running a name match per call site.
 *
 * 2. **Refuse before mutating.** A step that references a character that does
 *    not exist, an ambiguous reference, a panel that is not there, a creation
 *    the user never asked for, or a generation that would duplicate an asset
 *    already in the library is rejected while the document is still untouched.
 *    Previously these surfaced as mid-run step failures, which is how a run
 *    could place the wrong character and keep going.
